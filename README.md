# heroku-time
Build a web app that prints out the number of seconds since the start of January 1st, 1970, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). 

It only needs to display the time as of rendering, not updated in real-time. In other words, display the time using Python, not JavaScript.
Build it using Flask.
Deploy to Heroku.
The site is available at `lw642-time.herokuapp.com`.
